### Working Papers: 

"Temporary Migration and the Skill Composition of Native Workers" 
(with Alessandra Faggian and Jonathan Corcoran)
* <small>Abstract: 
This paper estimates the effect of a major skilled visa program in Australia on the wages and skill composition of the native workforce. We examine whether skilled international workers ‘crowd-out’ native workers, or induce a shift in the occupation-specific skills performed by native workers. We combine data from the full population of approved subclass 457 visa applications with the nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia longitudinal survey (HILDA) from 2001-2015. Our findings indicate that skilled international workers increase the wages of natives, and induce native workers to specialize in occupations associated with a high intensity of communication and cognitive skills.  We find no evidence of negative effects of the visa program on the wages of high-skill or low-skill native workers, or on previous migrants who may be close substitutes to the skilled visa holders. </small>


"Naturalization and the Productivity of Foreign-Born Doctorates"
(with Alessandra Faggian)
*  <small>Abstract: 
This paper estimates the effect of obtaining U.S. citizenship on individual level measures of productivity for foreign-born doctoral recipients from U.S. universities. Becoming a United States citizen results in the removal of barriers such as access to public sector occupations and to some sources of government sponsored research funding which are hypothesized to increase the productivity of foreign-born scientists. We utilize panel data from the Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR) from 1993-2013 and individual fixed effects models to control for selection bias in the naturalization decision. Our results indicate that becoming a naturalized citizen increases wages and several measures of academic productivity.  In support of our argument, we find that foreign-born workers who naturalize are more likely to utilize research funding from a government agency, but not more likely to work for the government post-naturalization.  </small>
  
 
"USDA’s Business and Industry (B& I) Loan Program and Business Dynamics" 
(with Anil Rupasingha and John Pender)
* <small> Abstract:
The USDA's Rural Development (RD) has implemented several loan and grant programs to support businesses located in rural areas and the Business and Industry Loan (B&I) Program is the largest of program among them. The focus of the present study is to estimate the impact of B&I program participation and the amount of loans received on the probability of survival and employment growth of recipient businesses over the period of 1990 to 2013. Using administrative data on B&I loans from RD and business-level data from the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS), we utilize a matched difference-in-difference estimation strategy to assess the impact of the B&I loan guarantee program on establishment-level outcomes. We find that the receipt of a B&I loan helps recipient businesses to reduce risk of failure and grow slightly faster, compared to a similar control group of businesses. </small>
