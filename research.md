### Job Market Paper: 

"Temporary Migration and the Skill Composition of Native Workers" 
* <small>Abstract: 
This paper estimates the effect of a major skilled visa program in Australia on the wages and skill composition of the native workforce. I examine whether skilled international workers ‘crowd-out’ native workers, or induce a shift in the occupation-specific skills performed by native workers. I use individual application data from the full population of approved Temporary Work (subclass 457) visa applications to measure the share of new visa holders in a local labor market. Information on labor market outcomes for native workers is drawn from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey (HILDA), a nationally representative panel of Australian workers from 2005-2015. The identification strategy overcomes the endogenous sorting of skilled immigrants into regions with favorable labor market conditions by using a combination of fixed effects models and an instrumental variables strategy. Findings indicate that skilled international workers increase the wages of natives, and induce native workers to specialize in occupations associated with a high intensity of communication and cognitive skills. I find no evidence of negative effects of the visa program on the wages of high-skill or low-skill native workers, or on previous migrants who may be close substitutes to the skilled visa holders. </small>
