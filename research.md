      <summary>Abstract: (Click to expand)</summary>
This paper estimates the effect of a major skilled visa program in Australia on the wages and skill composition of the native workforce. Specifically, whether policies that seek to attract and
temporarily employ skilled international workers result in crowd-out, or a shift in occupation-specific skills for native workers. To answer these questions, we combine three separate datasets: (1) the
full population of subclass 457 visa approved applications in Australia, (2) the skills performed in each occupation from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database, and (3) the
nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia longitudinal survey (HILDA) from 2001-2015. We find that having a high share of temporary visa holders in a region
results in native workers specializing in occupations which require more cognitive and communication skills. Furthermore, we estimate that skilled immigrants increase the wages of natives, which is
consistent with the explanation that immigrant and native workers perform complementary tasks in the production process.
