### About Me:
I am an economist with research interests in immigration, labor economics, and rural development. My previous research has studied skilled immigration policies in the United States and Australia, rural business dynamics, and gender wage inequality. This research has been published in journals including *Research Policy, Journal of Regional Science, Oxford Economic Papers, Industrial and Corporate Change*, and the *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*. My ongoing research studies the labor market assimilation of immigrants in the U.S. and Australia, and the role of social connectivity in determining immigrant settlement patterns. 

I am currently employed at the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in the Long-Term Analysis Unit. At CBO, I have worked on the agency's long-term population projections and long-term projections of the federal budget and Social Security finances.
