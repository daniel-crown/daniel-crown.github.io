# About Me:
I am a third year PhD student in the Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics Department at The Ohio State University.  My research focuses on studying the labor market impact of high skill immigration in developed countries.  In my current projects, I study the Subclass 457 Skilled Temporary Visa program in Australia, the H-1B visa program in the United States, and the effect of foreign-born scientists on productivity and innovation in the United States.
