### About Me:
I am a PhD student in the Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics Department at The Ohio State University.  My research is focused on the labor market impact of high skill immigration in developed countries.  In my current projects, I study two skilled visa programs in Australia, the H-1B visa program in the United States, and the effect of foreign-born scientists on productivity and innovation in the United States.
